However, it soon began to be used more broadly to describe anything that was not straight or direct. This could include objects, thoughts, or even emotions.\n\nOblique has come to be associated with words like indirect and devious. It is often used to describe people or ideas that are not straightforward or honest. It can also be used to refer to something that is not as it appears, such as an oblique reference or an oblique comment.\n\nIn modern usage, the word oblique is still used to describe anything that is slanted or angled.

It is based on a natural defense mechanism found in bacteria, wherein \u201cclustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats\u201d (CRISPRs) and associated proteins (Cas9) are used to target and recognize specific sequences of DNA. Using this technology, researchers can make targeted changes to the DNA sequence of any organism with great precision and accuracy.\n\nCRISPR-Cas9 technology has a wide variety of potential applications. It can be used to modify the genetic code of plants and animals for agricultural and medical purposes, such as creating crops that are more resistant to pests and diseases, developing treatments for genetic diseases, and improving the production of food and medicine. Additionally, it can be used to modify the genetic code of microbes for industrial and environmental applications, such as producing biofuel, degrading pollutants, and increasing the efficiency of bioreactors.\n\nDespite its many potential applications, the use of CRISPR-Cas9 technology has raised some ethical concerns. For example, some worry that it could be used to create designer babies, introducing traits into the population that could have unforeseen consequences. Additionally, there is a risk that it could be used to create \u201csuperbugs\u201d that are resistant to antibiotics, or to create weapons of mass destruction. As a result, some governments have passed laws and regulations restricting the use of gene-editing technologies.\n\nIn conclusion, gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9 technology has the potential to revolutionize the fields of agriculture, medicine, and industry.

{"dataset": "koala", "instruction": "Write me a 2000 word essay on a water safety engineering project.", "output": "Water safety engineering is a highly important field of engineering that focuses on the safety of water resources and the protection of water quality. Projects related to water safety engineering can range from analyzing the potential for water contamination due to agricultural runoff, to designing and constructing water treatment plants, to developing methods of controlling water levels in reservoirs and rivers. Water safety engineering projects can also involve the development of new technologies to reduce the risk of waterborne diseases, as well as the development of technologies to improve the efficiency of water distribution systems.\n\nThe purpose of this essay is to discuss a water safety engineering project. Specifically, the project will focus on the development of a water purification system that will be used in a rural village in India. The system will be designed to provide clean drinking water to the village's population of approximately 500 people. \n\nThe project will begin by carrying out an initial assessment of the water needs of the village. This assessment will involve the collection of information about the existing water supply in the village, as well as the quality of the water. The assessment will also include the collection of information about the water sources that are available to the village, such as rivers, lakes, and groundwater sources. This information will be used to determine the quantity and quality of water that is available to the village, as well as the types of water treatment technologies that will be required to provide clean drinking water.\n\nThe next step of the project will involve the selection of a suitable water treatment technology. This will involve researching and evaluating various water treatment technologies, such as filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light disinfection. The selection of the most appropriate water treatment technology will depend on a number of factors, such as the availability of suitable raw materials, the cost of the technology, and the efficiency of the technology.\n\nOnce a suitable water treatment technology has been selected, the project will involve the design and construction of the water purification system. This will involve the selection and installation of suitable pumps, filters, and other components. The design of the system will also involve the selection of appropriate materials for the construction of the system, such as PVC pipes, stainless steel tanks, and other components. \n\nThe next step of the project will involve the installation and commissioning of the water purification system. This will involve testing the system to ensure that it is operating correctly and that it is producing clean drinking water. The system will also need to be tested to ensure that it meets the requirements of the local regulatory bodies.\n\nThe final step of the project will involve the monitoring and maintenance of the system. This will involve regular testing of the water to ensure that it is safe for drinking, as well as the regular maintenance of the system components. Additionally, the project will involve the implementation of a water management plan to ensure that the water is used efficiently and that it is not wasted.\n\nIn conclusion, this essay has discussed a water safety engineering project that will involve the development of a water purification system for a rural village in India. The project will involve the collection of information about the existing water supply in the village, the selection of a suitable water treatment technology, the design and construction of the water purification system, the installation and commissioning of the system, and the monitoring and maintenance of the system. With the successful completion of this project, the villagers will be provided with clean drinking water, thus improving their quality of life.", "generator": "text_davinci_003"}

Throughout the 1930s, Disney produced a number of successful animated films, including Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Pinocchio, Dumbo, and Fantasia. \n\nIn the 1940s, Disney began to focus more on live-action films, producing a number of classic films such as Treasure Island and The Three Caballeros. He also created the Disneyland theme park in 1955. In the 1960s, Disney produced a number of live-action films, including The Parent Trap and Mary Poppins. He also began to create the first Disney animated films in color, including The Jungle Book and The Aristocats. \n\nThe 1970s saw the release of a number of Disney classics, including Robin Hood, The Rescuers, and The Fox and the Hound. In the 1980s, Disney released a number of successful animated films, including The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and The Lion King. The 1990s were a time of expansion for the company, with the opening of Disney World in Florida and the purchase of a number of major media companies, including ABC and ESPN. \n\nIn the 2000s, Disney continued to produce animated films, such as Lilo & Stitch and Finding Nemo, as well as the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie. The company also expanded its presence in Asia, opening several theme parks in China and Japan. In the 2010s, Disney released a number of successful films, including Frozen, Zootopia, and Moana.
